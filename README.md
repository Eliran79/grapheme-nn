# GRAPHEME
### Graph Representation through Adaptive Pattern Hierarchy and Emergent Modular Encoding

*No vocabulary. No limits. Just understanding.*

Revolutionary neural architecture that processes text without tokenization, growing dynamic graphs from characters (graphemes) for true language understanding.

**Status**: Active Research & Development
**Paper**: In preparation
**Language**: Rust

## Documentation

| Document | Description |

## Key Features

- **Vocabulary-free**: Direct character-to-node mapping, no tokenization
- **Dynamic graphs**: Network topology grows with input complexity
- **Universal**: Works with any Unicode text without language-specific preprocessing
- **Efficient**: Sublinear memory scaling through hierarchical compression

## Architecture Overview

```
Text → Character Nodes → Dynamic Graph Growth → Graph Transformations → Output
```

Processing text as evolving graph structures rather than static token sequences enables truly universal, scalable, and interpretable language understanding.
