# Define Multi-Modal Fusion Traits (Phase 4)

## Context
The GRAPHEME vision doc mentions multi-modal processing but it's underspecified. Currently only text→graph is implemented. For grounded intelligence, need unified representation across vision, audio, language, and action.

**Gap Analysis**: Without multi-modal fusion, GRAPHEME:
- Only processes text, not images/audio
- Cannot ground language in perception
- Cannot generate actions from understanding

## Objectives
- Define trait for multi-modal graph fusion
- Enable cross-modal inference
- Support attention binding across modalities
- Create modality-agnostic graph representation

## Tasks
- [ ] Define `Modality` enum (visual, auditory, linguistic, tactile, action)
- [ ] Define `ModalGraph` type (graph + modality tag)
- [ ] Define `MultiModalGraph` trait
- [ ] Define cross-modal attention/binding
- [ ] Create `grapheme-multimodal` crate skeleton

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Unification:**
- All modalities map to same Graph structure
- Cross-modal connections possible
- Modality-specific properties preserved

✅ **Inference:**
- Can infer across modalities
- Attention spans modality boundaries
- Translation between modalities

## Technical Notes

### Core Structures
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub enum Modality {
    Visual,
    Auditory,
    Linguistic,
    Tactile,
    Proprioceptive,
    Action,
}

pub struct ModalGraph {
    pub graph: Graph,
    pub modality: Modality,
    pub timestamp: Option<Timestamp>,
}

pub struct MultiModalEvent {
    pub components: Vec<ModalGraph>,
    pub bindings: Vec<CrossModalBinding>,
}

pub struct CrossModalBinding {
    pub source: (Modality, NodeId),
    pub target: (Modality, NodeId),
    pub strength: f32,
}
```

### Trait Definition
```rust
pub trait MultiModalGraph: Send + Sync {
    /// Fuse multiple modality graphs into unified representation
    fn fuse(&mut self,
        visual: Option<ModalGraph>,
        auditory: Option<ModalGraph>,
        linguistic: Option<ModalGraph>,
        tactile: Option<ModalGraph>
    ) -> Graph;

    /// Translate content from one modality to another
    fn translate_modality(&self, source: &ModalGraph, target: Modality) -> ModalGraph;

    /// Bind representations across modalities (e.g., word ↔ image region)
    fn cross_modal_bind(&mut self, event: MultiModalEvent) -> Graph;

    /// Attend to specific modality
    fn attend(&self, unified: &Graph, modality: Modality) -> Graph;

    /// Extract modality-specific subgraph
    fn extract(&self, unified: &Graph, modality: Modality) -> Option<ModalGraph>;
}
```

### Example: Vision-Language Binding
```rust
// Bind "cat" text node to visual region
let linguistic = ModalGraph {
    graph: text_to_graph("The cat sits on the mat"),
    modality: Modality::Linguistic,
    timestamp: None,
};

let visual = ModalGraph {
    graph: image_to_graph(cat_image),
    modality: Modality::Visual,
    timestamp: None,
};

let binding = CrossModalBinding {
    source: (Modality::Linguistic, cat_text_node),
    target: (Modality::Visual, cat_region_node),
    strength: 0.95,
};
```

### Files to Create
- `grapheme-multimodal/Cargo.toml`
- `grapheme-multimodal/src/lib.rs`
- `grapheme-multimodal/src/modality.rs`
- `grapheme-multimodal/src/fusion.rs`
- `grapheme-multimodal/src/binding.rs`

## Testing
- [ ] Fusion combines modality graphs
- [ ] Translation preserves semantic content
- [ ] Binding creates cross-modal edges

## Updates
- 2025-12-05: Task created from AGI gap analysis

## Session Handoff (AI: Complete this when marking task done)

### Dependencies & Integration
- Depends on: api-002 (core Graph types)
- Required by: api-009 (Grounding)
