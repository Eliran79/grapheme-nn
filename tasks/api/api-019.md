# Create agent discovery and registry service for A2A

> **⚠️ SESSION WORKFLOW NOTICE (for AI Agents):**
>
> **This task should be completed in ONE dedicated session.**
>
> When you mark this task as `done`, you MUST:
> 1. Fill the "Session Handoff" section at the bottom with complete implementation details
> 2. Document what was changed, what runtime behavior to expect, and what dependencies were affected
> 3. Create a clear handoff for the developer/next AI agent working on dependent tasks
>
> **If this task has dependents,** the next task will be handled in a NEW session and depends on your handoff for context.

## Context
Brief description of what needs to be done and why.

## Objectives
- Clear, actionable objectives
- Measurable outcomes
- Success criteria

## Tasks
- [x] Create AgentRegistry struct with configuration
- [x] Implement register/deregister/update operations
- [x] Add skill indexing for fast skill-based lookups
- [x] Add tag indexing for tag-based discovery
- [x] Implement DiscoveryQuery with multiple filters
- [x] Add health status tracking (active, unavailable, unknown)
- [x] Add auto-remove for unhealthy agents
- [x] Create AgentCardBuilder and SkillBuilder helpers
- [x] Implement registry statistics
- [x] Write 18 unit tests
- [x] Export module from lib.rs

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Criteria 1:**
- Specific, testable criteria

✅ **Criteria 2:**
- Additional criteria as needed

## Technical Notes
- Implementation details
- Architecture considerations
- Dependencies and constraints

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if applicable
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass before marking task complete
- [ ] Consider edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always test AND run before committing!**

- [ ] **BEFORE committing**: Build, test, AND run the code to verify it works
  - Run `cargo build --release` (or `cargo build` for debug)
  - Run `cargo test` to ensure tests pass
  - **Actually run/execute the code** to verify runtime behavior
  - Fix all errors, warnings, and runtime issues
- [ ] Commit changes incrementally with clear messages
- [ ] Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why"
- [ ] Consider creating a feature branch for complex changes
- [ ] Review changes before committing

**Testing requirements by change type:**
- Code changes: Build + test + **run the actual program/command** to verify behavior
- Bug fixes: Verify the bug is actually fixed by running the code, not just compiling
- New features: Test the feature works as intended by executing it
- Minor changes: At minimum build, check warnings, and run basic functionality

## Updates
- 2025-12-11: Task created

## Session Handoff (AI: Complete this when marking task done)
**For the next session/agent working on dependent tasks:**

### What Changed
- Created `grapheme-train/src/a2a_registry.rs` (~730 lines)
- Key types: AgentRegistry, AgentEntry, AgentStatus, DiscoveryQuery, DiscoveryResult, RegistryConfig, RegistryStats, AgentCardBuilder, SkillBuilder
- Added module export in lib.rs

### Causality Impact
- Register adds agent to agents HashMap + skill/tag indexes
- Deregister removes from all indexes
- Health updates can auto-remove agents after max_failed_health_checks
- Discovery queries use indexes for fast lookups

### Dependencies & Integration
- Uses types from a2a_protocol module (AgentCard, Skill, etc.)
- Integrates with A2A agent cards for capability discovery
- No external dependencies added

### Verification & Testing
- Run: `cargo test -p grapheme-train a2a_registry::`
- Expected: 18 tests pass
- Key tests: test_find_by_skill, test_discovery_query, test_auto_remove_unhealthy

### Context for Next Task
- AgentCardBuilder/SkillBuilder make creating test data easy
- Tag deduplication prevents duplicate URL entries in indexes
- Capacity is configurable (default 1000 agents)
- Health checking is manual (call update_health) - no automatic scheduler
